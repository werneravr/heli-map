## 🌍 Why This Project Exists

Table Mountain National Park has restricted airspace to protect wildlife and ensure visitor safety. However, helicopter operators sometimes violate these restrictions, either accidentally or intentionally. This system:

1. **Monitors Compliance**: Provides objective evidence of airspace violations
2. **Supports Enforcement**: Generates reports for regulatory bodies like SACAA
3. **Improves Safety**: Helps identify problematic flight patterns
4. **Protects Wildlife**: Reduces helicopter noise pollution in sensitive areas
5. **Provides Transparency**: Offers public visibility into airspace violations

The data helps aviation authorities, park management, and concerned citizens understand the scope of violations and take appropriate action.

## 🚀 Quick Start

Note! 
Always restart the server after running node generate-master-metadata.cjs
Or run node generate-master-metadata.cjs before starting the server
Check the server logs for messages like "🚀 Loaded X flights from master metadata" to confirm it's using the fast path

### 🚁 KML Validation Portal

The system includes a **KML Validation Portal** accessible at:
- **Local Development**: `http://localhost:4000/validate`
- **Production**: `https://yourdomain.com/validate`

**🚀 Complete Workflow Integration**: The validation portal now automatically handles the entire process that previously required manual steps. After uploading KML files, it automatically:
- Renames files to proper format (YYYY-MM-DD-REGISTRATION-HASH.kml)
- Generates PNG flight path images
- Updates master metadata
- Clears server cache
- Makes flights immediately accessible in the main interface

**Features:**
- **Drag & Drop Interface**: Upload multiple KML files at once
- **Automatic Validation**: Checks if flights enter TMNP restricted airspace
- **Complete Processing**: Automatically renames files, generates PNG maps, and updates metadata
- **Smart Filtering**: Only saves violating flights, rejects non-violating ones
- **Real-time Results**: Immediate feedback on validation status with processing details
- **Ready to Use**: Violating flights immediately appear in main tracking interface
- **Local-Only Access**: Endpoint is secured to prevent external abuse

**How to Use:**
1. Navigate to `/validate` in your browser
2. Drag & drop KML files or click "Choose Files"
3. Click "Validate Files" to process
4. Review results - only violating flights are saved to your system
5. **Automatic processing** - Files are renamed, PNG maps generated, and metadata updated
6. **Ready to use** - Flights immediately appear in your main tracking interface with full functionality

**Security Note**: The validation endpoint only accepts connections from local networks (127.0.0.1, 192.168.x.x, 10.x.x.x, 172.x.x.x) to prevent external abuse while keeping your code public.

### Development Setup

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Generate master metadata for ultra-fast server startup:**
   ```bash
   node generate-master-metadata.cjs
   ```
   *This processes all KML files once and creates optimized metadata for instant loading*

3. **Start the development servers:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev:all
   ```
   - Frontend: http://localhost:5173
   - Backend: http://localhost:4000

4. **Or start production server:**
   ```bash
   npm run build  # Build frontend first
   npm start      # Serves everything on http://localhost:4000
   ```

### Adding New KML Files - Optimized Workflow

1. **Drop KML files** into `server/uploads/`

2. **Process new files (one command does everything):**
   ```bash
   node process-new-kmls.cjs
   ```
   This script will:
   - ✅ Rename files to proper format (YYYY-MM-DD-REGISTRATION-ID.kml)
   - 🖼️ Generate PNG flight path images
   - 📝 **Update master metadata incrementally** (only processes new files)
   - 🗑️ Clear server cache
   - ⚡ Ensure fast server startup

3. **Commit changes to git:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add new helicopter flights"
   git push
   ```

4. **Deploy automatically** - Render will build and deploy in 2-3 minutes

## 📊 Data Structure

### Master Metadata System
The system now uses a pre-generated metadata file (`server/master-metadata.json`) containing:
```json
{
  "flights": [
    {
      "filename": "2025-06-01-ZS-RTG-3a9862ef.kml",
      "registration": "ZS-RTG",
      "date": "2025-06-01", 
      "time": "07:53",
      "owner": "Cape Town Helicopters",
      "imageUrl": "https://cdn.jetphotos.com/200/5/541479_1728643363_tb.jpg?v=0",
      "fileSizeMB": 1.23
    }
  ],
  "generatedAt": "2025-01-23T10:30:00.000Z",
  "totalFlights": 422,
  "totalSizeMB": 1128.39
}
```

### KML Files
Flight data is stored as KML files with a standardized naming convention:
```
YYYY-MM-DD-REGISTRATION-HASH.kml
```
Examples:
- `2025-06-01-ZS-RTG-3a9862ef.kml` (Cape Town Helicopters)
- `2025-05-25-ZT-REG-3a7dc922.kml` (Private owner)

### Flight Metadata
Each flight includes:
- **Date/Time**: When the flight occurred
- **Registration**: Aircraft registration (e.g., ZS-RTG, ZT-REG)
- **Owner**: Operator name (Cape Town Helicopters, Private owner, etc.)
- **Source**: Data source (FlightRadar24, ADS-B Exchange)
- **File Size**: Pre-calculated size in MB (0.46-2.16+ MB range)
- **Image URL**: Aircraft photo from JetPhotos
- **Coordinates**: GPS tracking points throughout the flight
- **Violations**: Points where aircraft entered restricted airspace

### Generated Maps
Each KML file has a corresponding PNG flight map showing:
- **OpenStreetMap Background**: Detailed terrain and landmarks
- **TMNP Boundaries**: Red restricted airspace zones
- **Flight Path**: Blue line showing aircraft route
- **Violation Markers**: Red warning icons at violation points
- **Metadata**: Aircraft registration, date, and owner information

## ➕ Adding New Flight Data

### Optimized Workflow (Recommended)
```bash
# 1. Add KML files to server/uploads/
# 2. Process everything with one command:
node process-new-kmls.cjs

# 3. Commit and deploy:
git add .
git commit -m "Add new helicopter flights"  
git push
```

**What happens automatically:**
- ✅ File renaming and metadata extraction
- 🖼️ PNG map generation  
- 📝 Master metadata update (incremental)
- 🗑️ Cache clearing
- ⚡ Ready for ultra-fast server startup

### Manual Metadata Regeneration
If you need to regenerate all metadata from scratch:
```bash
node generate-master-metadata.cjs
```

**When to run this:**
- After major changes to KML processing logic
- If master metadata becomes corrupted
- Before major deployments (optional)

### Data Sources
The system accepts KML files from:
- **FlightRadar24**: Commercial flight tracking (most common)
- **ADS-B Exchange**: Open source aircraft tracking
- **Manual Imports**: Custom KML files with proper format

### File Format Requirements
KML files must contain:
- Aircraft registration in name field or placemark name
- Timestamp data in `<when>` elements or placemark names
- Coordinate data in `<coordinates>` or `<gx:coord>` elements

## 🔌 API Endpoints
